Examples
========

This section contains hands-on, runnable examples from the repository's
``examples/`` folder. Each example has its own page (linked below) with a
brief explanation, the script, instructions to run it, and suggestions for
modifications.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   examples/*

Overview
--------

- Each example page includes: a short description, the source (embedded via
  ``literalinclude``), run instructions, and notes on expected output.
- Examples are grouped by skill level; see the examples index for grouping.

Run examples locally
--------------------

From the project root run any example script, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    python examples/example_static_qubit.py

If you want to build the full docs locally and preview, run your usual Sphinx
build command (for example ``make html`` in the ``docs/`` folder).
